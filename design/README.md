Design directory

This folder holds design docs, specs, and exported assets for handoff.

Structure
- mockups/: PNG/JPG exports of high-fidelity mockups
- specs/: redlines, spacing tokens, responsive behavior
- assets/: production-ready images (SVG/PNG/ICO), organized per story

Conventions
- Use kebab-case filenames
- Include story key prefix (e.g., ctppoc-87) for traceability
- Keep source design files in your design tool; export only here
