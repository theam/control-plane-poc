AI Agents are autonomous programs that perceive, reason, and act to achieve goals.
They integrate tools, memory, and planning to solve complex tasks end-to-end.
In teams, agents collaborate, delegate subtasks, and verify each otherâ€™s outputs.
Good agents are reliable, explainable, secure, and aligned with user intent.
This repository includes examples and workflows to build and evaluate AI agents.
