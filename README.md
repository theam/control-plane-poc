- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with components.
- It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI based on state changes.
- JSX lets you write markup-like syntax that compiles to React.createElement calls.
- Hooks (like useState and useEffect) enable state and side effects in function components.
- Reactâ€™s ecosystem includes React Router, Redux, and tooling like Vite and Next.js.
